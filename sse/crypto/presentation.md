## What we can talk about

* What is security?
* How secure are you?
* Attack vectors
* 

---

## What do you care about?

What do you want to prevent? Consider the *threat*:

* Is your data valuable to someone else?
* Are your systems valuable to someone else?
* What prevents them from doing that?
  * Make a list of defensive measures

???

* Is your data valuable to someone else?
  * Sell it?
  * Blackmail?
  * Steal money or resources?
  * Embarrass somebody important?
  * Threaten to or actually cause downtime?
* Are your systems valuable to someone else?
  * CPU time?
  * Disk space?
  * Network bandwidth?
  * IP addresses?
  * Access to other systems?
* What prevents them from doing that? - brainstorm

## How secure are you?

How would you crack the defensive measures that we just listed?

## Absolute security

> The only truly secure system is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards - and even then I have my doubts. - [Gene Spafford](http://spaf.cerias.purdue.edu/quotes.html)

Security is **impossible** if:

* some users have additional rights (privileges)
* you cannot distinguish people using only laws of physics
* you cannot make it physically impossible to violate policy

---

## Living with insecurity

* **Can't** be completely secure
* **Can** make individual attacks more expensive.
* Beware the side effects (systems harder to use)

---

## Reducing specific risks

* Use encrypted communications
* Use multi-factor authentication
* Verify authenticity of messages
*
